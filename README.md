# EvaNIL
Silver standard dataset for large-scale NIL entity linking evaluation.

Built from existing Biomedical and Life Sciences corpora.

![Dataset generation schema](https://github.com/pedroruas18/EvaNIL/blob/main/evaNIL.png)

## Setup environment

Dockerfile includes the commands to setup a Docker image with the appropriate environment.


## Retrieve necessary data
To download the required knowledge base and corpora files:

```
./download_data.sh
```


## Build the dataset

To build a given partition of the dataset:

```
python src/dataset.py <partition>
```

Arg
- partition: the selected partition to build.

Options:
- "medic" (CTD-MEDIC)
- "ctd_anatomy" (CTD-Anatomy)
- "ctd_chemicals" (CTD-Chemicals)
- "chebi" (ChEBI)
- "go_bp" (GO-Biological Process)
- "hp" (HPO)

Example:

```
python src/dataset.py chebi
```

Output: train.json, dev.json and test.json in ./dataset/chebi dir

## Statistics

To get dataset statistics:
```
python src/statistics.py <partition>
```

Arg
- partition: the selected partition to build.

Options:
- "medic" (CTD-MEDIC)
- "ctd_anatomy" (CTD-Anatomy)
- "ctd_chemicals" (CTD-Chemicals)
- "chebi" (ChEBI)
- "go_bp" (GO-Biological Process)
- "hp" (HPO)

Example:
```
python src/statistics.py chebi
```

Output:
```
Total number of documents: 97
Total number of annotations: 4091
Annotations per document: 42.175257731958766
Max number of annotations per document: 315
Min number of annotations per document: 2
3699 annotations (90.41799071131753 %) with 1 word
327 annotations (7.993155707650941 %) with 2 words
51 annotations (1.246638963578587 %) with 3 words
11 annotations (0.2688829137130286 %) with 4 words
2 annotations (0.048887802493277926 %) with 5 or more words
```


## Baseline model
The baseline model is based on string matching and uses python [fuzzywuzzy](https://pypi.org/project/fuzzywuzzy/).

To apply the baseline model over the built dataset:

```
python src/baseline.py <partition>
```
Arg
- partition: the selected partition to build.

Options:
- "medic" (CTD-MEDIC)
- "ctd_anatomy" (CTD-Anatomy)
- "ctd_chemicals" (CTD-Chemicals)
- "chebi" (ChEBI)
- "go_bp" (GO-Biological Process)
- "hp" (HPO)
- "all"

Example:
```
python src/baseline.py chebi
```
Output:
```
Total docs ( chebi ): 10
Total annotations ( chebi ): 358
Correct answers: 13
Accuracy ( chebi ): 3.6312849162011176

Partition runtime: 114.79057455062866 s

Total runtime: 114.79064726829529 s
```

Predicted answers for the annotations are outputted in the file "baseline_chebi_answers.csv" in ./results dir


To apply baseline model over all partitions of EvaNIL dataset:

```
python3 src/baseline.py all
```

## Python Multiprocessing
The functions used to parse documents from the PubMed DS corpus and to find the best candidate in the baseline model were adapted to allow parallel processing using the Pool class from [Python Multiprocessing package](https://docs.python.org/3/library/multiprocessing.html). 

For example, the task of finding the best candidate in the knowledge base for all entities followed a map-reduce architecture: the input was distributed to 20 cores and then the output was collected, being returned in a list. In the graph, we can observe the runtime of original baseline model vs the implementation using Multiprocess when applied to the test set of the split 1 of MEDIC partition:
